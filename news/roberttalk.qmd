Abstract: Recent developments in generative diffusion models have contributed
to a wide variety of application areas, from image generation to drug discovery
and numerical weather prediction. In this talk, we will provide a
self-contained introduction to the mathematical principles of diffusion models,
driven by what we will refer to as the forward and backward stochastic
processes. We will also look at some examples of image generation and examine
the dynamical phase transitions evident in the backward process. Students of
all levels of mathematical background and interest are encouraged to attend!
