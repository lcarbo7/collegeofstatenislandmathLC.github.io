The cosmos and its laws have fascinated people since the ancient times. Many
scientists and philosophers have used mathematics to formulate their ideas and
compute predictions. Today, we have made huge progress in understanding the
universe. In this lecture, you will hear about two of the most famous
physicists of all time, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, and about their
theories of the universe. You will learn about common features and central
differences in their viewpoints and in the mathematics they used to formulate
their theories.
