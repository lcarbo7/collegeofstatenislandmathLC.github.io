Juggling has been performed for thousands of years, almost as long as
mathematics has been studied. Only in the last few decades have these two
subjects come together and this has helped to develop new patterns and ideas
for juggling. We will cover the basics, and show how to discover new juggling
patterns. Steve Received his Ph.D. in Mathematics at University of California,
San Diego. His primary mathematical interests are spectral graph theory,
enumerative combinatorics, mathematics of juggling, discrete geometry, and
generally mathematics of fun things.
