For two thousand years, mathematicians tried to prove that Euclidean geometry,
the geometry you probably learned in high school, was all there was. But it’s
not! In the early nineteenth century, János Bolyai and Nikolai Lobachevsky
independently discovered that by tweaking one of Euclid’s rules, geometry can
look totally different. We will explore the rich world of hyperbolic geometry,
one of the new and beautiful systems of geometry that results from this tweak.
Our guides on the adventure will be mathematically inspired artists and
artistically inspired mathematicians, including M.C. Escher, Daina Taimina, and
Henry Segerman.
