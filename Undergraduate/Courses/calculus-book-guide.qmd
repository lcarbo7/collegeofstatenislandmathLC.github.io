Calculus instructors have an option of using Achieve or Webworks for their Calculus sections.

## Instructors using Achieve

Students are required to buy Achieve which comes with a homework system and an online book. Here are the available options to buy Achieve:

Achieve (1-term):  (Bookstore ISBN: 9781319411657)

Achieve (4-term):  (Bookstore ISBN: 9781319438333)

Loose-leaf + Achieve (1-term):  (Bookstore ISBN: 9781319411671)

Loose-leaf + Achieve (4-term): (Bookstore ISBN: 9781319438357)

## Instructors using WeBWorK:

Since WeBWorK is free, students do not need to buy any homework system. However students are required to obtain the text book either through Achieve (as above) or a used book or rent a book.

## Student Options:

Students taking only one semester of Calculus are suggested to buy the 1- term access to Achieve.

- Access to the online book expires after Achieve subscription expires. If students want to have a hard copy of the book, students can choose the “Loose- leaf” option above.

## Students planning on taking more than one semester of Calculus:

Recommended to buy the 4-term access to Achieve, irrespective of whether students will enroll in Achieve sections or Webwork sections in subsequent semesters.

* If enrolled in an Achieve section, they can use their online book if they enroll in a Calculus Webwork section in subsequent semesters.

* If they have bought a 1-term access to Achieve, they will be able to upgrade their Achieve subscriptions to a 4-term access by paying the difference.

* If enrolled in a Webwork section, they may be required to buy Achieve if they enroll in a Calculus Achieve section in subsequent semesters.
