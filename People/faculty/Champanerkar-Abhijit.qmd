## Biography

 My area of research is hyperbolic 3-manifolds and knot
theory. Thurston established the importance of hyperbolic geometry and
geometric invariants in the study of 3-manifolds and knot theory. I am
interested in the deformations of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds
and interactions between hyperbolic geometry with number theory. Jones
revolutionized knot theory by introducing the Jones polynomial in 1984
which led to families of diagrammatic invariants. My current research
is motivated by the problem of relating geometric invariants like
hyperbolic volume to diagrammatic invariants like the Jones
polynomial. I am also interested in understanding knots from the point
of view of graph theory.

Dr Champanerkar earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University
in 2003. Before joining CSI he worked for one year at Barnard College,
Columbia University as a postdoc and for four years at the University
of South Alabama as an Assistant Professor.

Dr. Champanerkar is a member of a Focused Research Group (FRG) that
received an NSF-FRG grant for collaborative research on topics in
geometric topology. With this funding, Dr. Champanerkar has
co-organized two major international conferences, with a special focus
on the Volume Conjecture. Dr. Champanerkar is a co-organizer of the
Geometry and Topology seminar at the CUNY Graduate Center.  For
