Dr. Lancellotti's field of interest is Mathematical Physics, with
special emphasis on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
Statistical mechanics strives to understand how the properties of
macroscopic physical systems arise from the interactions among huge
numbers of microscopic entities, such as atoms and molecules. This
type of question leads to fascinating and hard mathematical
problems. In particular, Dr. Lancellotti has been working on the
so-called kinetic theory of plasmas and gravitating systems.  These
are assemblies of many electrically charged particles (plasmas) or
large populations of stars (galaxies, globular clusters) that
interact through inverse-square forces (e.g. gravity).  Over the
years, physicists have assembled a body of beautiful theoretical
models, called kinetic equations, that are supposed to describe
mathematically the behavior of these systems.  However, the current
understanding of the solutions to these complicated differential
equations is still very limited.  Hence the need to apply advanced
mathematical methods in order to investigate such solutions and
compare them with the the phenomena that are observed in nature.
Also, the mathematical analysis is often supplemented by numerical
simulations that shed light on the nature of the solutions being
investigated.

Among other things, Dr. Lancellotti has published research papers
on wave propagation in plasmas and on the dynamics of clusters of
stars.  He is currently studying the equations that regulate energy
dissipation in plasmas and gravitating system (Landau and
Lenard-Balescu equations), and also the so-called Kuramoto model,
that describes the dynamics of large assemblies of oscillating
systems (for example, crickets, heart cells and other biological
systems).  His research is currently supported by a three-year grant
from the National Science Foundation and also by a smaller PSC-CUNY
grant, and is conducted in collaboration with other researchers both
at the College of Staten Island and at other research institutions.

 My area of research is hyperbolic 3-manifolds and knot
theory. Thurston established the importance of hyperbolic geometry and
geometric invariants in the study of 3-manifolds and knot theory. I am
interested in the deformations of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds
and interactions between hyperbolic geometry with number theory. Jones
revolutionized knot theory by introducing the Jones polynomial in 1984
which led to families of diagrammatic invariants. My current research
is motivated by the problem of relating geometric invariants like
hyperbolic volume to diagrammatic invariants like the Jones
polynomial. I am also interested in understanding knots from the point
of view of graph theory.

Dr Champanerkar earned his Ph.D. at Columbia University
in 2003. Before joining CSI he worked for one year at Barnard College,
Columbia University as a postdoc and for four years at the University
of South Alabama as an Assistant Professor.

My favorite topics of interest are the properties of Brownian motion,
random walk and their local times.  In the last few years I was
working on the fine properties of iterated processes, logarithmic
averages, some integral functional of certain stochastic
processes. One of the main goal of my investigation was to develop a
general strong approximation method which allow us to study certain
processes through the investigation of the corresponding iterated
process. This led to the strong approximation of a wide class of
additive functionals.Another related topic of investigation was on
the measure of heavily visited points of the Brownian motion.

Recently I got interested in the fine properties of the maximal local
time and occupation time of the simple d-dimensional random
walks. Questions about maximal local time on subsets, maximal
occupation time of a finite set, multiplicity of the set of points
with a given local time, and joint asymptotic behavior of local and
occupation times of random walks in higher dimension are the object of

The focus of my research is knot theory and geometric topology.  Knot
theory is one of the most active research areas of mathematics
today. Much of this research is closely connected with mathematical
physics, and many results are of interest to biologists.  For such a
rich field of mathematical ideas, the "price of admission" is low for
great undergraduate research projects.


My current research is motivated by a deep open problem: how to bridge
the chasm between quantum and geometric topology.  Thurston
established the importance of geometric invariants, especially
hyperbolic volume, in low-dimensional topology.  A revolution in
knot theory was ushered in with the discovery of the Jones
polynomial in 1984, which led to vast families of quantum
invariants.  My aim is to establish the relationship between quantum
invariants of a knot, such as the Jones polynomial, and the geometry
of the knot complement.

that when a weak shock wave reflects off a thin wedge, a reflection
pattern consisting of three shock waves that meet at a "triple
point" apparently occurs.  Von Neumann showed, however, that such a
point is impossible - it cannot conserve mass, momentum, and
energy. Therefore, the apparent triple point must have an unknown
local structure of small but finite size.  To study this phenomenon,
problems for several systems of conservation laws, including the
[Euler equations

have led to a determination of the local structure near the apparent
triple point, and theoretical analysis shows that this structure
provides a resolution of the paradox.  Recent experimental evidence
appears to confirm this resolution.
