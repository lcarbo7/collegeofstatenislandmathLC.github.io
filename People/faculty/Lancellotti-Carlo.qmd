## Biography

Dr. Lancellotti's field of interest is Mathematical Physics, with
special emphasis on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
Statistical mechanics strives to understand how the properties of
macroscopic physical systems arise from the interactions among huge
numbers of microscopic entities, such as atoms and molecules. This
type of question leads to fascinating and hard mathematical
problems. In particular, Dr. Lancellotti has been working on the
so-called kinetic theory of plasmas and gravitating systems.  These
are assemblies of many electrically charged particles (plasmas) or
large populations of stars (galaxies, globular clusters) that
interact through inverse-square forces (e.g. gravity).  Over the
years, physicists have assembled a body of beautiful theoretical
models, called kinetic equations, that are supposed to describe
mathematically the behavior of these systems.  However, the current
understanding of the solutions to these complicated differential
equations is still very limited.  Hence the need to apply advanced
mathematical methods in order to investigate such solutions and
compare them with the the phenomena that are observed in nature.
Also, the mathematical analysis is often supplemented by numerical
simulations that shed light on the nature of the solutions being
investigated.

Among other things, Dr. Lancellotti has published research papers
on wave propagation in plasmas and on the dynamics of clusters of
stars.  He is currently studying the equations that regulate energy
dissipation in plasmas and gravitating system (Landau and
Lenard-Balescu equations), and also the so-called Kuramoto model,
that describes the dynamics of large assemblies of oscillating
systems (for example, crickets, heart cells and other biological
systems).  His research is currently supported by a three-year grant
from the National Science Foundation and also by a smaller PSC-CUNY
grant, and is conducted in collaboration with other researchers both
at the College of Staten Island and at other research institutions.
