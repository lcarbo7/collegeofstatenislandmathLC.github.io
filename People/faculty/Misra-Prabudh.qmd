## Biography

My research interests are in the fields of *Semigroups of Continuous
Selfmaps* and *Rings of Continuous Functions*.  The former area had
considerable growth in the last four decades and my work pertains to
studying Peano Continua and their associated semigroups, Near-rings of
continuous selfmaps on a topological group - mostly their automorphism
groups along with epimorphism and monomorphism theorems for such
near-rings. In rings of continuous functions area, an attempt to find
algebraic properties on these rings that would characterize metric
spaces led me to give a unified proof of some isomorphism theorems and
also a local isomorphism theorem for metric spaces.

I received a Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and an
M.Sc. degree from Allahabad University, India. After spending about
two years at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, I
spent the late 70's teaching at the Federal University of Goias and
the early 80's at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil. I
have been teaching since the Fall of 1984 at The College of Staten
Island, The City University of New York. I am actively involved in
organizing the weekly *New York Seminar on Topology and Topological
Algebra* after moving to Staten Island. Our seminar group initiated
and has organized several *Summer Topology Conferences& and we have
edited the proceedings of these conferences.
