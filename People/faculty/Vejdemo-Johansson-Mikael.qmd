## Biography

Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson started out in computational homological
algebra, studying algorithms for computing invariants of Tor modules
and A?-algebra structures on the modular group cohomology rings of
p-groups. After finishing his PhD, he has worked during postdoctoral
studies at Stanford University (2008-2011), University of St Andrews
(2011-2012), KTH Royal Institute of Technology (2012-2013, 2014-2015)
and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, University of
Minnesota (2013-2014) on Topological Data Analysis: using persistent
homology and cohomology to compute descriptors for abstract point
clouds, and the Mapper algorithm generalizing Reeb graphs and nerve
simplicial complex constructions to produce intrinsic topological
model spaces for arbitrary data. He seeks out application realms
anywhere he can find them, and has published work on applications to
parliamentary voting records, to the statistics of color naming
systems in linguistics, to motion capture data.




In addition to these primary research interests, he has worked on
enumerating tie knots, finding 262862 possible tie knots using formal
languages and algebraic systems of equations.
